# Swarming with Mesa

Agent based modelling with Python's Mesa package. Reproduces fish schools swarming behaviour in a fully synchronous manner, as opposed to NetLogo's swarming and flocking models, which are inherently asynchronous (due to parallelization)

## Project Status

In progress, starting stage

## Visuals

Coming soon

## Installation

Fork or download this repository on your local machine. 

### Requirements

This code was developped under Ubuntu (20.04.2 LTS)

Install [Mesa](https://mesa.readthedocs.io/en/master/) with `pip install mesa`
Make sure you have Numpy installed in your Python environment.

## Usage

For help understanding the Mesa framework, checkout [doc/MESAHELP](https://github.com/ClaireGuerin/mesa/blob/develop/doc/MESAHELP.md)

To run the default model, use command line `python run.py` in terminal.

## Roadmap

- basic fish school placed on grid
- individual fish movement based on others (rules of cohesion, avoidance and alignment)
- visual output
- dynamic parameter control
